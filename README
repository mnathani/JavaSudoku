At present, this program is unable to solve Sudoku puzzles of a certain 
difficulty. For example input-hard.txt

Theory:

One strategy to solve such Sudoku puzzles is to follow normal solving 
strategies and making a guess when only 2 numbers can possibly occupy 
a spot.

Either the puzzle will get solved, or some contradictions will arise.
If contradictions arise, then it is known that the guess is wrong 
and the other value is correct.
